Shortbread
====
  

A delicious URL shortener. See it live at http://shrtb.red.

Setup

Shortbread is made with Ruby on Rails.

Install rails:

``` ruby
sudo gem install rails
```

Set up your gems:

``` ruby
bundle install
```

Set up the database:

``` ruby
rake db:migrate
```

This app uses Postgres for the database.

You'll need a domain to point shortened links to. In link.rb, replace `URL_BASE = "shrtb.red/"` with whatever domain you want to serve shortened URLs from.

Shortened URLs are case-sensitive, so bear that in mind.

The site tracks the top 100 most visited links. You can adjust this in the constant `MOST_VISITED_LIMIT` in link.rb.

Test Suite

This app uses Rspec. To run tests on the Link model, simply type:

``` ruby
rspec
```
